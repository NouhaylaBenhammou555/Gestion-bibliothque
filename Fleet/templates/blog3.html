It goes without saying, this is a tall order for a team to handle, let alone one person. Hence, finding the best fleet management software becomes a top priority for managers who need an immediate and smart solution. 
            <br>
In this article, we’re going to investigate whether you need such software, a few key features to look out for; and, how to choose the best fleet management platform for your fleet business.

        <h3>​Do you need a fleet management system?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>To get straight to the point, if you can relate to the following statements, well then, chances are that you do. Read on to find out!</p>
        
            <h4>You need a practical fleet administration solution</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Processing and keeping track of administrative tasks is hard, since they require constant attention and thorough organization; not to mention, a lot of hands-on work. With fleet management software, shift scheduling, travel expenses management, mileage reports for the IRS, and keeping customers informed become simplified; even automated.
            </p>
            <h4>You need full visibility over fuel consumption</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Fuel is a huge cost for most fleet companies, and, unfortunately, it’s also hard to tackle; since it’s directly linked with other fleet matters, such as routing, maintenance, and driving behavior. Good news is that even a slight increase in fuel efficiency can benefit your company’s bottom line; and the best fleet software can help you achieve it.
            </p>
            <h4>You need better maintenance management</h4>
            <br>
            <p>The best fleet management software offers the ability to set real-time alerts and notifications that can help you be proactive; that is, act before any of your vehicles start malfunctioning. Undoubtedly, this will help you optimize fleet maintenance — and keep its costs as low as possible.
            </p>
            <h4>You need to monitor driver behavior</h4>
            <br>
            <p>By monitoring and analyzing driver behavior, you can get many valuable insights; which, you can turn into immediate actions to streamline your fleet operations. For instance, the software will inform you when a driver: 
            <br>
                <span class="spc">Leaves the vehicle idling </span>
                <span class="spc">Uses more fuel than expected</span>
                <span class="spc">Doesn’t follow the optimal route</span>
                <span class="spc">Drives the car for personal use</span>
                <span class="spc">Drives dangerously — cases of distracted or aggressive driving, even road rage</span>
            </p>
